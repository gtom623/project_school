## 2 Docker Installation  (second installation method)

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### Step 1: Clone the repository

Clone this repository onto your local machine using git. Open the terminal and enter:

```
git clone https://github.com/gtom623/project_school.git
cd project_school
```
### Step 2: Build and run the containers

In the repository directory, where the docker-compose.yml file is located, use the docker-compose command to build and run the containers:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
The --build flag is used to build the images before running the containers.

Docker will create 3 containers:

 ✔ Container school-db

 ✔ Container project_school-school-1        

### Step 3: Run migrations to recreate the database structure
```
  docker exec project_school-school-1  bin/cake migrations migrate
```
### Step 4: Open the application in your browser

After the containers are up and running, your application should be accessible in the browser. Open your browser and go to:
```
aplication homepage                                 -  http://localhost:8765
phpmyadmin   (school_db user: school pass:school)   -  http://localhost:8080
```

### Stopping the Application

```
docker-compose down
docker rmi project_school-school mysql phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin
```
